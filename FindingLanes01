**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

One of the main task on the development of any Self Driving Cars project is to identify the the way where the car will be drived.
When the road have lane lines, this will be more natural reference for the driving as it is for human drivers.

This goal of this project is to develop a Pipeline that permit recognize the Lane Lines on the Road.

### Reflection

### 1. Pipeline


The pipeline consiste in five steps:

1.-  Convertion to grayscale 

2.- 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

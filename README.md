**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

One of the main task on the development of any Self Driving Cars project is to identify the way where the car will be driving.
When the road have lane lines, those are the more natural and basic references for driving, as it is for human drivers.

The goal of this project was to develop a set of procedures (pipeline) that permit recognize the Lane Lines on the Road.

The pipeline could be applied to a single image or to a video clip.

### Reflection

### 1. Pipeline


The pipeline consiste in five steps:

1.-  Convertion to grayscale

2.- Prueba + Otra

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by â€¦

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ...

Another shortcoming could be ...
